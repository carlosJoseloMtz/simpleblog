# About

Simple implementation of a mini-blog engine that works just fine

# Considered features

* Display the preview content
* Manage multiple users
* Very basic information of the users
* Comments right out of the box! (no secure check implementation, thought, might want to be able to disable this via environment config)

# Tech stack!

* ReactJS (as an appshell) and NodeJS


Why? I just didn't have anything better to do :dog:
